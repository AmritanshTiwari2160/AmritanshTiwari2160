### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Amritansh Tiwari
I'm a passionate BTech CSE student at Graphic Era Hill University with a strong interest in technology and coding.

Currently, I'm diving deep into algorithms and programming languages like C++, alongside exploring Full Stack Web Development. ðŸš€

ðŸŒ± I love learning and experimenting with new technologies, from building projects that integrate machine learning to diving into the world of web development frameworks.

ðŸ”­ I'm actively honing my skills on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces, always up for new challenges and problem-solving adventures.

ðŸ’¬ Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities in the world of tech together!
